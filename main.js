                    A conversation with Ray Garcia, Jonathan Gold, Evan Kleiman, Bricia Lopez, 
                    and Carlos Salgado about the evolving role of Mexican cuisine in LA as culture, 
                    art, and craft Together, critic Jonathan Gold, food scholar Evan Kleiman, and
                    chefs Ray Garcia, Bricia Lopez, and Carlos Salgado have spent more than a lifetime
                    preparing, eating, and writing about Latin American cuisine. Before their recent 
                    panel discussion at the Getty, offered in conjunction with Pacific Standard Time,
                    they sat down with us to reflect on the role of Mexican cuisine in the life of
                    Los Angeles and how we might expand our taste buds to go deeper.

                    The highest point in my life is being with close family and friends, 
                    in the backyard over a fire, cooking over the course of many hours, 
                    sitting under the sky, and just filling this space with so much warmth. 
                    When I'm cooking there, I feel much more like an artist than when I
                    worked in the highest-concept restaurants. They are like museums of food,
                    accessible only with a certain level of literacy on the part of the diner,
                    with a certain level of cultural experience and background.
